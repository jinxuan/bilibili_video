特别是因为我还我很喜欢做注释，这是另一件有助于我理解我正在阅读，我在我最喜欢的下面划了线引语有两个原因，首先是因为我

我觉得这让我关注每一个一个字，因为事实上我可以强调一些不我一定要去，但我能做到这一点，说明我

actually really focusing on each lineand also on each individual word as welland the second reason is a bit moresentimental I think that a physical booktells two stories one is the story that

is printed on the page in black andwhite that the author wrote for you andthen the other is the story of youreading it and so I underline things Ihighlight my favorite passages I've
页面上印有黑色和作者为您和另一个是你的故事阅读时，我会在下面划线突出我最喜欢的段落

我想说的是，做一个积极的读者不要只是被动地浏览页面，要积极思考请思考写作及其质量

writing and for me that's really crucialto taking in all of the words on thepage and the final thing I'll say onthis is Look up the definition of wordsthat you don't understand I know this
对我来说，这一点至关重要将所有的字词最后我要说的是这就是查字典我知道这一点

sounds obvious but for a long time Ididn't do this and I feel like I missedout on so much meaning this helps me tostay engaged because it means thatthings aren't just going over my head
听起来很明显，但长期以来，我没有这样做，我觉得我错过了这有助于我因为这意味着事情不是我想的那样

because authors choose very specificwords for very specific reasons you knoweach word has a nuanced meaning and itwas chosen for a reason and so if I'mnot familiar with that word I look it up
因为作者选择了非常具体的有非常具体的原因每个词都有细微的含义，它被选中是有原因的，所以如果我不熟悉这个词，我查了一下

and then I can appre appreciate whatthey're trying to tell me I know thatKindles and e-readers make thisespecially easy CU you can just likehold down the word and it will give you
然后我就能体会到他们想告诉我，我知道Kindle 和电子阅读器让这一切成为可能特别简单的 CU，你可以像按住单词，它就会给你

的细节或特定人物但我想说，大部分我对这本书的印象就是我的评论所以当有人问我哦，你读过《大城市之恋》吗？

when I tell them yes I have I'mbasically recalling my 100 to 200wreview rather than trying to rememberthe 90,000 words that are in the bookdoes that make sense so I basically have
当我告诉他们是的，我有基本上回顾了我的 100 至 200 瓦复习，而不是试图记住书中的 9 万字这样说有道理吗？

thing is to return back to these reviewsreread what you wrote and challengeyourself think about what you thought Ithink part of the reason I have such agreat memory of the books I've read is
就是回到这些评论重读你写的内容并提出质疑你自己想想你认为我我觉得我之所以有这样的在我读过的书中，印象最深的是

问我如何看待对大城市 我会记住我的想法而不仅仅是我可以走了，是的，你知道，这很好因为你并没有说

anything when you just say yeah it wasgood it was okay it was fine and thatleads me on to talking about how toreview books because it is much moreintellectual to be able to say why you
当你说是的时候很好，很好，很好让我继续谈谈如何因为它更能说出为什么你

enjoyed a book rather than just sayingyes I enjoyed it or no I did not enjoyit the most important thing for me is tothink about did the author achieve whatthey set out to do think about author
喜欢一本书，而不仅仅是说是的，我很喜欢，或者不是，我不喜欢对我来说，最重要的是想一想作者是否实现了思考作者

intention as well as your subjectiveresponse to the author's work whether Iliked the book or not is always kind ofsecondary for me what comes first is didthe author achieve what they intended to
意图以及您的主观对作者作品的回应，无论我喜欢或不喜欢这本书总是有点对我来说，首先要做的是作者达到了他们想要达到的目的

do and the next most important thing forme is to always ask yourself why I wouldrather someone gave me a detailedreasoning as to why they hated myfavorite book than someone saying yeah I
最重要的事情是我总是问自己，为什么我会而是有人给了我一份详细的为什么他们讨厌我最喜欢的书，而不是有人说是啊，我

read your favorite book and I thought itwas good like why did you think it wasgood what about it made it good oralternatively what about it did you notlike why did you not like it that for me
读了你最喜欢的书，我觉得它很好，为什么你认为它是好在哪里？或者说，你有什么不满意的地方？比如，你为什么不喜欢我这样做？

is the interesting bit not whether youliked it or not so be specific you knowif you found the book boring was thatbecause the pacing was too slow or wasit because you didn't resonate with the
有趣的不是你是否不管你喜不喜欢，说清楚如果你觉得这本书很无聊，那是因为因为节奏太慢或因为你对它没有共鸣

subject area cuz those are two verydifferent things so like what was itthat didn't appeal to you what was itthat made you lose interest lose focuswhy did you not like it and then
因为这是两个非常不同的事情，所以你不喜欢的是什么？让你失去兴趣失去注意力你为什么不喜欢它，然后

expanding on that and going back toauthor intention did the author do thosethings intentionally deliberately youknow if they made the pace slow was thatbecause they were trying to build up a
在此基础上，再回到作者的意图是什么？刻意为之如果他们让节奏慢下来因为他们试图建立一个

kind of atmosphere was that afundamental part of their storytellingso I always challenged myself to thinkwhy did I not like this thing ratherthan just did I like it or not and then
这种氛围是他们讲故事的基本要素所以我总是挑战自己去思考为什么我不喜欢这件事而不是我喜不喜欢，然后

the follow-up question to that is whatcould have been done differently to makeme like it more so for example maybethere were too many peripheralSide characters who didn't feel
后续问题是本可以用不同的方法使例如外围因素太多没有感觉的旁观者

necessary or weren't developed enough toWarrant being part of the book one thingI always pick up on is when an authortells you oh yeah these two charactersare best friends but we never see the
必要或不够发达让权证成为本书的一部分是一回事当作者这两个角色是最好的朋友，但我们从未见过

Friendship we never see the softness orthe intimacy of that Bond and that's oneof my like Pet Peeves in literature whenthey tell you rather than showing you Iwant to see like a cute little anecdote
我们从未见过友谊的柔软或邦德的亲密关系，这是一个我最讨厌的文学作品是他们告诉你，而不是向你展示想看一个可爱的小轶事

of that friendship and without that Idon't really feel like it's believablejust cuz the author told me somethingdoesn't mean I believe it to be true andso that's something I always challenge
没有这种友谊，我感觉不太可信只是因为作者告诉了我一些事情并不意味着我相信它是真实的，而且所以我一直在挑战

myself to think about when I'm readingreading a book is how would I improvethis you know if this was delivered tome as a manuscript as a draft and I wasbeing asked for constructive criticism
阅读时的思考阅读一本书，我将如何提高您是否知道这封信是否送到了我的手稿是草稿，我是被征求建设性批评意见

or feedback what would I tell the authorwhat would I say I think you couldimprove on how could this be made into abetter book and I think asking yourselfthat question means that you're being
或反馈，我该如何告诉作者我想你可以如何将其改进为更好的书，我想问自己这个问题意味着你被

more thoughtful and considerate of thework that has been put in front of youand immediately your commentary is somuch more interesting now I'll talkabout things to consider when you're
更周到、更体贴工作而你的评论又是如此现在有趣多了时需要考虑的事项

reading in a moment but while we'retalking about reviews I also wanted toaddress the flip side of this which isreading other people's reviews whetherthat's in a newspaper whether that's in
但当我们谈到评论，我还想解决这个问题的反面，即阅读他人的评论是否在报纸上，无论是在

a literary journal or whether that'sjust on social media or Goodreads Ipersonally would try not to read anyoneelse's review until I have formed myopinion I want to make sure that I've
文学期刊，还是只是在社交媒体或 Goodreads 上，我我个人会尽量不阅读任何人在我形成自己的我想确保我已经

established my opinion and my thoughtsfirst so that then when I come toreading other people's reviews which Ireally love to do I am engaging withthose reviews critically and I'm
确立了我的观点和想法这样，当我来到阅读其他人的评论，我我真正喜欢做的事情这些评论都是批判性的，我

thinking do I agree with this or not andif not why not so to give you an examplesomeone might read the book boy parts byEliza Clark and they might think oh thischaracter wasn't that likable they
我是否同意这样做？如果没有，为什么不呢？有人可能会读到伊丽莎-克拉克，他们可能会这样想他们的角色并不讨人喜欢

weren't a good a morally good person andtherefore they hated the book becausethey didn't like the character but maybeI read the book and I liked that thatcharacter was flawed I liked that they
不是一个道德高尚的好人，而且因此，他们讨厌这本书，因为他们不喜欢这个角色，但也许我读了这本书，我喜欢人物有缺陷，我喜欢他们

were a little bit messy I liked thatthey felt real and I feel that that wasactually the author's intention to writea character who was not perfect and thatis the beauty of reacting to art that we
有点乱，我喜欢他们感觉很真实，我觉得那是其实作者的写作意图一个不完美的角色，而且对艺术做出反应的美妙之处在于我们

all have a different response and that'swhere thought-provoking discussionshappen in which no one is right no oneis wrong but we can have a healthyconversation where we share our
都有不同的反应，这就是发人深省的讨论没有人是对的，没有人但我们可以有一个健康的对话，分享我们的

different opinions on the piece of artand our different responses to it that'snot only okay it's actively encouragedso what should you consider when readinga book I feel like this is the big one
对作品的不同看法以及我们对它的不同反应不仅可以，而且积极鼓励那么，在阅读时应该考虑什么呢？一本书，我觉得这是最重要的一本书

so I'm going to go through a couplethings that I am always keeping like inthe back of my mind when I approach anovel firstly perspective who is tellingthe story are they a reliable narrator
所以，我要通过几个我一直保留的东西，比如当我接近一个小说第一视角故事的叙述者是否可靠

do we trust what they say is the thestory told from the first second orthird person perspective the firstperson I is vulnerable it's intimateit's Soul bearing it means that a lot of
我们是否相信他们所说的从第一秒或第一人称视角我是脆弱的，它是亲密的它是灵魂的承载，它意味着许多

the time we're moving through the actionat the same Pace as the main characterwe know what they know on the flip sideif a firstperson narrator withholdssomething from the reader doesn't tell
我们在行动中的时间与主角同步反过来，我们知道他们知道什么如果第一人称叙述者隐瞒从读者那里得到的东西并不能说明

us something that they know but we don'tthen that is an unreliable narratormeanwhile a second person narratoraddresses the reader as you this is isreally really really hard to pull off I
他们知道而我们不知道的东西那么这就是一个不可靠的叙述者同时采用第二人称叙述向读者致辞真的真的很难做到

think a book that does it exceptionallywell is open water and this can have theimpact of being very direct and poignantlike we as the reader of the collectiveyou that they are speaking to and that
认为这本书做得特别好水井是开阔水域，这可能会非常直接和凄美的影响就像我们作为读者的集体他们在和你说话，而且

makes for a very very immersiveexperience then the other style ofperspective we can have is third personthat is much more omniscient it kind oflooks at what's happening and unfolding
让人身临其境体验，那么另一种风格的我们可以有第三人称的视角它更无所不知，有点像观察正在发生和展开的事情

from a bird's ey View and talks aboutwhat every character is individuallykind of going through one reallyinteresting way of using the Third thirdperson is through what's called free
从鸟瞰视角，讲述每个角色的个性我真的经历了一次使用 "第三第三 "的有趣方式是通过所谓的自由

indirect discourse which basically movesthat we move freely between differentperspectives someone who does thisreally really well is Jane Austin andmore recently Sally Rooney uses it in
间接话语，基本上是我们可以在不同的观点简-奥斯汀和最近，萨莉-鲁尼在

normal people in which Connell andmarann are both miscommunicating but asthe reader we're in both of their headsso we empathize with both of them and Ithink that is really really fascinating
康奈尔和马兰都沟通不畅，但由于读者在他们两人的脑海中因此，我们对他们两人感同身受，我真让人着迷

now the next thing that I would considerwhenever I'm reading a book is thepacing so is the book Fast medium orslow paced and how does that impact thenarrative books like pony boy or Paul
接下来，我会考虑每当我阅读一本书时本书的节奏是快中还是慢？节奏缓慢，这对小马哥》或《保尔》等叙事书
